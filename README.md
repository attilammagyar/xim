(Work-in-progress) My first attempt at music unmastering and unmixing.

This is a work-in-progress pet project - if you found this repo looking for
actually useful music unmixers, try one of these:

 * [HDemucs](https://docs.pytorch.org/audio/stable/tutorials/hybrid_demucs_tutorial.html),
 * [HTDemucs](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs),
 * [BS-RoFormer](https://github.com/lucidrains/BS-RoFormer),
 * or simply use the built-in track splitter tool in [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/)
   (it works with the demo version as well).
